# BracketlessProgramming

As a personal challenge and to deepen my understanding of C#, I thought it would be a good exercise to see if I could write a program without using a single bracket ("{" or "}").

After diving into the project, I believe it's impossible.

That said, I got pretty darn close. I wrote the common console game High Low using only two brackets; the ones needed to define the class body.
