# BracketlessProgramming

I took on the following challenge to myself to deepen my understanding of C#:

**Write a program that doesn't use any brackets.**

I quickly found out it wasn't possible (or at least I believe it not to be), since you need a mininum of four brackets just to get a "Hello World" program to compile. 

Ignoring those four though, it's mind-bending how far your compiler will let you get without the warm embrace of those curly braces.

In this repo is my version of the popular (among developers and only among developers) console game Hi-Lo, using only four brackets.
