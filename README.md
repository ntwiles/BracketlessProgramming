# BracketlessProgramming

I took on the following challenge to myself to deepen my understanding of C#:

Write a program that doesn't use any brackets.

I quickly found out that was (I believe) impossible, since you need a mininum of four brackets just to get a "Hello World" program to compile. What can be done though, I believe, is to write a great number of programs using only four brackets.

In this repo is my version of the popular (among developers and only among developers) console game Hi-Lo, using only four brackets.
