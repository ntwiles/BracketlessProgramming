# BracketlessProgramming

As a personal challenge and to deepen my understanding of C#, I thought it would be a good exercise to see if I could write a program without using a single bracket ("{" or "}").

I got pretty darn close. I wrote the common console game High Low using only two brackets; the ones needed to define the class body.


After diving into the project, I believe it's impossible (at least in C# 8) to get any closer than that. With Top Level Programs in C# 9 that looks like it will change and it will become possible to remove those remaining two brackets.
